# Course Selection

The Course Management System is a key project for universities and students.
There are two types of users for this system: Admin and User. 
The Admin can manage the system, like adding or changing courses,
and looking at user registrations. Users, including students and faculty, 
can sign up for courses, see what courses are available, and get up-to-date information.
The system will use PHP and MySQL for secure and efficient management of courses,
making it a useful tool for both managing and choosing educational courses

## Installation
